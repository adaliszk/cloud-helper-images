# Cloud Helper Images
Helper docker images to deploy and monitor cloud services easily at scale.

### Why?
While nothing wrong with hand crafting things for every project, I've got tired of it and
thought why not share the tools I'm using to manage Micro-Services on various scale.

### What's in the Repo?
- Base-Images
- Disaster-Recovery
- Monitoring
- Alerting

### Contribution
If you found the images useful,  I would appreciate if you leave a star on Docker-HUB and 
on GitHub! Pull-Requests are welcomed, but at this stage I'm actively updating  the code;
you may end up out of sync very quickly!
